Dependencies
------------

Building pyenet requires all the same dependencies as enet plus Cython
and, obviously, Python.

Installation
------------

From pypi
~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip install pyenet

Manually from git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the setup.py build:

::

    $ python setup.py build

Once that is complete, install the new pyenet module:

::

    # python setup.py install

Packaging notes
---------------

-  update package version in ``setup.py``
-  create a virtualenv
   (``python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate``)
-  install the requirements: ``pip install -r dev-requirements.txt``
-  build the source dist: ``python setup.py sdist``
-  make sure docker is installed and running and you re on a 64bit linux
   machine
-  build the binary dists: ``./scripts/build_packages.sh``
-  upload to pypi: ``twine upload dist/* wheelhouse/pyenet*``
-  commit, tag, push to github

Usage
-----

Once you have installed pyenet, you only need to import the enet module
to start using enet in your project.

Example server:

::

    >>> import enet
    >>> host = enet.Host(enet.Address("localhost", 33333), 1, 0, 0)
    >>> event = host.service(0)

Example client:

::

    >>> import enet
    >>> host = enet.Host(None, 1, 0, 0)
    >>> peer = host.connect(enet.Address("localhost", 33333), 1)
