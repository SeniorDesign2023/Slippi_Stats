1) Recap: The last three weeks is mostly familiarizing ourselves with Slippi and slippi.js, learning Electron,
and talking with the people at Slippi to figure out how to implement into the Slippi launcher.  

  
2) Tasks completed: Figuring out how to implement what we want to create into Slippi. Beckham had a meeting
with the Slippi lead Vince. During this meeting He learned several things that they would require our project
to do well before being able to be implemented, a list of stretch goals from their perspective, and provided
links to helpful resources we may need.  

   
3) Roadblocks/challenges: So far our biggest challenge has been finding a time that works for everyone's
schedule to meet. After talking to Ward we learned that we can meet just among us and then meet with the
mentor with one or two members absent. This will be very helpful, as everyone's schedules are vastly
different. We will be able to have small short meetings and random intervals to pass along information,
tasks, and converge knowledge, and then have the people who can make the mentor meetings pass along all
the information to them.  

  
4) Changes/Deviations: So far I do not believe we have any changes or deviations to the project. Though we
may later as we begin more development into the project.  

 
5) Confidence:  
  Beckham Carver: 8/10 I am very confident our team will be able to deliver our MVP and as interest and time
  allows be able to reach or expirement with our stretch goals. Managing our project to a high enough standard
  to be considered 'mergable' will be difficult and should itself be considered a stretch goal. Regardless,
  with the resources available to us we will be able to complete our goals.
  
  Kyle Lofthus: 5/5 I am confident we will be able to complete the project pitch. There are a couple "extras" 
  that we have listed as things to add and work on if we have time to do so. Those I am less sure on, but the 
  main project I am confident we can complete.      
  
  Ben Wilkin: I am confident in our ability to tackle this project. I think we are getting to a great start by 
  meeting with one of the project leads. We have been given some valuable guidance that will helpus get on the 
  right track. I along with everyone else will have to learn new languages but we have enough relevant experience
  to make that process relatively conformatable.  
  
  Zachary Crimmel:  9/10 I am really confident in this groups ability to tackle this project. We all have an 
  interest in SSBM and are all interested in the project. My only point of concern is dealing with new languages 
  and frameworks like Typescript and Electron. Though there is no more concern	than learning any new language or 
  framework so I am confident we will be able to complete it.  
  
  Michael Stoll:    

   
6) Group Dynamics: There have not been any problems among members of the group and the group dynamics have
been positive.
