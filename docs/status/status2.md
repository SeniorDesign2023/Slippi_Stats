1. Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks  
2. Tasks completed  
    a) Description of tasks completed (and by whom)
   
4. Successes  
    a) What were you group accomplishments?
       Coming up with a strong second project idea after the pitched project
       fell through due to Slippi deciding to do it themselves.
   
    b) Were there other things you tried that did not work and why?
       After the Slippi team decided to do our project themselves, one idea
       was to still go ahead and continue doing it anyway. However, we decided
       that probably wasn't the best idea, because of the amount of time to learn
       how to integrate with their existing code and then to create the project
       there would no way for us to produce something of as good quality as they
       would be able to themselves.
   
4) Roadblocks/challenges  
    a) Describe the challenges
       Having to completely change our idea to something else was time consuming.
   
    b) Did you overcome them or are there still challenges left?
       We did mostly overcome it. Having a short meeting and getting all members to
       vote on what the plan should be now and a rough general idea on what part of
       the work each member wants to be tasked with.
   
    c) Do you need help with it?  Can your mentor help or do you need external help?
       Our mentor is Ward, and during our last meeting with him he did provide advice
       on how we should proceed from here. This was for his opinion on which of path
       options from here should not be do to time, and encouraged a meeting between
       members to set up a plan and figure out division of labor.
   
6) Changes/Deviations from the project Pitch  
    A rather large deviation from our project pitch occured. Do to the main Slippi
    team deciding to do most of our origin pitch themselves, it left us in an
    awkward situation. We have decided to focus on more of the stuff we had planned
    as extra things to try if there was time. Specifically, our focus is now on
    using machine learning and the play files from Slippi matches as a dataset
    to build a model that can be trained to play like a real world player. Whether
    that player is your friend you want to beat, or potentially a pro player (the
    pro player copying will be the most difficult). There has been a few ideas for
    how to accomplish this, and ironing out the specifics is still in the works for
    the final planning document. 

8) Confidence on completion of the project for each team member and the group average  
    a) Scale of 1-5; 1 not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident.
       Kyle:    I am still confident we will be able to have a cool project to present
                By April. 5/5

10) Group dynamics  
    a) Is your group working or are there problems?
        Many of our group members have been extremely busy with othe classes this
        semester, but through our last meeting we have come to an understanding about
        ensuring this Spring semester will require a good amount of real coding time
        to complete the project.
