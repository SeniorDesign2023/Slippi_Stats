1. Recap:  
Everyone has gotten set up to begin programming, and individuals have been assigned a rough outline of tasks and  
have begun working on them. The current goal is to get a rough outline of the basics going for front-end and back-  
end to get a rough idea of how everything will come together.  
  
2. Tasks complete:  
    a) Description of tasks:  
    Everyone is set up to program with code that can be connected to the Slippi Launcher.  
    Ben and Zachary and begun the steps for the front-end.  
    Beckham, Michael, and Kyle have started the creation of bots with basic commands.  
    Beckham has a bot that can perform 360 degree movements.  
  
    b) Quantifiable metric(s):  
    Everyone has one computer that can be used to program code connected to the Slippi Laucher.  
    ////// we can add lines of code programmed here ///////  
    We have had two meetings that have proven very successful at getting everyone set up and assigned tasks, and  
    have been able to work through some early problems.  
      
3. Successes:
    a) Accomplishments:    
  
    b) What Solutions were Successful:  
      
    c) Things that did not work:  
    So far the thing that we did not get to work, was connect a linux computer to be able program into Slippi Lancher  

4. RoadBlocks/Challenges:  
    a) Challenges:  
    It was surprisingly difficult to get everyone set up to Slippi Laucher.  
      
    b) Overcame challenges:  
    Figured out that some specific libraries had to be installed in addition to the software for running Slippi and  
    Dolphin, and then having specific files saved to certain places, and set up in a way that the software could  
    access those file correctly.  
      
    c) What Challenges are left:  
    One challenge is figuring out how best to train a model to control a bot, and how many models. For example,  
    should each character have their own model, or should there be a primary model that decides when it's best to  
    have a "play style" (aggressive, defensive, evasive, etc), and then another bot that makes the decision of which  
    exact move to make for that character in that "play style."  

    d) What do we need help with:  
      
5. Changes/Deviations: N/A  
  
6. Details of goals/plan for next 3 weeks:  
    Front-end:  
      
    Back-end:  
      
7. Confidence:
