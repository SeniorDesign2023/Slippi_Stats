1. Recap:  
Everyone has gotten set up to begin programming, and individuals have been assigned a rough outline of tasks and  
have begun working on them. The current goal is to get a rough outline of the basics going for front-end and back-  
end to get a rough idea of how everything will come together.  
  
2. Tasks complete:  
    a) Description of tasks:  
    Everyone is set up to program with code that can be connected to the Slippi Launcher.  
    Ben and Zachary and begun the steps for the front-end.  
    Beckham, Michael, and Kyle have started the creation of bots with basic commands.  
    Beckham has a bot that can perform 360 degree directional movements.  
  
    b) Quantifiable metric(s):  
    We have had two meetings that have proven very successful at getting everyone set up and assigned tasks, and  
    have been able to work through some early problems.  
      
3. Successes:
    a) Accomplishments:    
    Getting everyone set up to be able to program code that is connected to the Slippi Laucher for testing code
    in gameplay.
    
    b) What Solutions were Successful:  
    Using Windows computers proved successful for getting everyone connected
        
    c) Things that did not work:  
    So far the primary issue we had was not getting a linux computer to connect and able to program into Slippi
    Lancher. There were instructions availble but only for using specific linux app store for downloading the
    software from.  

5. RoadBlocks/Challenges:  
    a) Challenges:  
    It was surprisingly difficult to get everyone set up to Slippi Laucher. Currently we still have several unknowns
    on timeframe and complexity of improving the AI bots to a competitive or even playable level. 
      
    b) Overcame challenges:  
    Figured out that some specific libraries had to be installed in addition to the software for running Slippi and  
    Dolphin, and then having specific files saved to certain places, and set up in a way that the software could  
    access those file correctly.  
      
    c) What Challenges are left:  
    One challenge is figuring out how best to train a model to control a bot, and how many models. For example,  
    should each character have their own model, or should there be a primary model that decides when it's best to  
    have a "play style" (aggressive, defensive, evasive, etc), and then another bot that makes the decision of which  
    exact move to make for that character in that "play style."  

    d) What do we need help with:
    At the moment I do not believe we need any help, though that they may change as we progress further into
    training AI models for the characters.
      
7. Changes/Deviations: N/A  
  
8. Details of goals/plan for next 3 weeks:  
    Front-end:  
      
    Back-end:  
      Get a couple different characters code for movement and basic offensive manuevers. Get one low-level AI made
      to control at least one character in a somewhat reasonable fighting manner.
             
10. Confidence:
      Kyle: 4/5 There are going to be some tricky parts for getting a model to be able to use multiple characters
            due to the vastly different movement abilities available.
