    Recap:
    We have begun programming both the front and backend towards their goals. We have come across some potentially  
    good solutions for getting the AI to work. While each of the backend people are still building out basic bots  
    that will be able to have more settings for better play, small steps have been made on the AI side as well.  
    Following some similar AI examples, Kyle has begun experimenting with training an AI model by having it play  
    the game. Beckham has delved into the Slippi files and has figured out a way that might allow us to overcome  
    a problem that several other Smash melee AI's have with some of the complex maneuvers. 

    Tasks complete:
    a) Description of tasks:
    Everyone is set up to program with code that can be connected to the Slippi Launcher.
    Ben and Zachary and begun the steps for the front-end.
    Beckham, Michael, and Kyle have continued the creation of bots with basic commands, and adding some advanced  
    commands.
    Kyle has begun experimenting with training an AI model to learn the game, through playing.
    

    b) Quantifiable metric(s):
    We have continued to have weekly meetings with the exception of Valentines day, due to that holiday and the  
    STEM career fair being held during that day.   
    
    Kyle has written a few hundred lines of code for the bot, but has cloned a few GitHub repos that are working  
    with AI and Smash melee, and begun reading through those and has written another few hundred lines of code  
    to begun replicating the basic AI attempts.

    Successes: a) Accomplishments:
    Bots have started to move and attack in an okay manner. AI has started being programmed for training.

    b) What Solutions were Successful:
    

    c) Things that did not work:
    So far the AI training has failed, or has not resulted in even a decent model. 

    RoadBlocks/Challenges:
    a) Challenges:
    Training the AI on a personal desktop. While the computer has descent specs, it is still slow for training

    b) Overcame challenges:
    Once some more bugs with the AI code are wrinkled out, plan on trying to run the program on ARCC and using  
    the HPC to greatly improve training time.

    c) What Challenges are left:
    

    d) What do we need help with: 

    Changes/Deviations: 

    Details of goals/plan for next 3 weeks:
    Front-end:
    We have decided to use Python's tkinter to create the UI for our project. Ben and Zach are familiarizing themselves with it and starting work on a window with a button that launches the working version.

    Back-end:  
    Still work on getting a few different characters to have good playable bots, and get at least one AI that  
    can operate a character well.  

      
    Confidence:
    Kyle: 4/5 Still confident we will have the bots working for playing though the milestone of a workable AI  
    that can learn how to play like another player I am much less confident on given the remaining timeline  
      
    Ben: 4/5 I haven't worked with tkinter in a very long time but I am confident that I can learn it very quickly for our purposes. My enviroment is set up for back-end as well when it's called for.
    Beckham: 4/5 as we've started coding the weirder portions of programming for melee are showing up. This will increase the difficulty for making move selection in generalized chains as certain action codes are unclear or mapped unintuitively. Nonetheless our goals are clear and the documention is solid.
    Zachary: 4/5 I ran into a bit of a hiccup just getting the virtual environment and lib melee up and running but this is most likely just the usual issues of trying to get a new environment set up. TKInter seems fairly simple to get up and running and I am confident that Ben and I can get a good looking Frontend developed by April.
