    Recap:
    We have begun programming both the front and backend towards their goals. We have come across some potentially  
    good solutions for getting the AI to work. While each of the backend people are still building out basic bots  
    that will be able to have more settings for better play, small steps have been made on the AI side as well.  
    Following some similar AI examples, Kyle has begun experimenting with training an AI model by having it play  
    the game. Beckham has delved into the Slippi files and has figured out a way that might allow us to overcome  
    a problem that several other Smash melee AI's have with some of the complex maneuvers. 

    Tasks complete:
    a) Description of tasks:
    Everyone is set up to program with code that can be connected to the Slippi Launcher.
    Ben and Zachary and begun the steps for the front-end as well as setting up bots to get familiar with the back-end.
    Beckham, Michael, and Kyle have continued the creation of bots with basic commands, and adding some advanced  
    commands.
    Kyle has begun experimenting with training an AI model to learn the game, through playing.
    
    

    b) Quantifiable metric(s):
    We have continued to have weekly meetings with the exception of Valentines day, due to that holiday and the  
    STEM career fair being held during that day.   
    
    Kyle has written a few hundred lines of code for the bot, but has cloned a few GitHub repos that are working  
    with AI and Smash melee, and begun reading through those and has written another few hundred lines of code  
    to begun replicating the basic AI attempts.
    Beckham set up a Trello board with detailed milestones and actions for assigning work.

    Successes: a) Accomplishments:
    Bots have started to move and attack in an okay manner. AI has started being programmed for training.

    b) What Solutions were Successful:
    Trello so far has been helpful for getting people up to date and on task. We may rely on it less as we enter crunch time.

    c) Things that did not work:
    So far the AI training has failed, or has not resulted in even a decent model. 

    RoadBlocks/Challenges:
    a) Challenges:
    Training the AI on a personal desktop. While the computer has descent specs, it is still slow for training
    Getting organized work completed has been difficult, we've been working as individuals and not fully as a team.

    b) Overcame challenges:
    Once some more bugs with the AI code are wrinkled out, plan on trying to run the program on ARCC and using  
    the HPC to greatly improve training time.

    c) What Challenges are left:
    Getting the bulk of the backend built is going to require some man hours. The structure is well defined but we'll need to put in the work for the # of files that need to be made.

    d) What do we need help with: 
    As we enter into March we may need help with engagement. We also may inquire about super-computer access as Kyle expirements more with ML.

    Changes/Deviations: 

    Details of goals/plan for next 3 weeks:
    Front-end:
    We have decided to use Python's tkinter to create the UI for our project. Ben and Zach are familiarizing themselves with it and starting work on a window with a button that launches the working version.

    Back-end:  
    Still work on getting a few different characters to have good playable bots, and get at least one AI that  
    can operate a character well.  
    Complete the Abstract Class structure for bot delineation, notably the chain section needs work.
    Reach our Trello major milestone 1 by March 8th.

      
    Confidence:
    Kyle: 4/5 Still confident we will have the bots working for playing though the milestone of a workable AI  
    that can learn how to play like another player I am much less confident on given the remaining timeline  
      
    Ben: 4/5 because we are progressing a little slowly but our front-end roles and goals are well defined now with deadlines.  Our work shouldn't be difficult on the frontend and we are set to have a bare-bones gui by next Wednesday.
    Beckham: 4/5 progress was slower than I would've liked, assigning concrete goals for each member is working well so far and reassures me that we will be able to complete the project, even if it will innevitably require some 'goblin mode' days.
    Zachary: 5/5 Progress on the front-end of the project is moving smoothly. We got a good amount of actionables donw to start working on and  
    with the Trello board have clear direction of who's doing what.
