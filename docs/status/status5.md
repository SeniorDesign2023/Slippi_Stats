Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks  
    Getting at least one character finished to be used in conjure with the front-end to start testing  
    API calls from the front-end settings to adjust the character's play parameters.    
    
Tasks Completed What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom)  
    Kyle pushed several files to GitHub that are all meant to be used as parts of the basic controls  
    for characters. Currently there are only two characters that have files for them set up, Fox, and  
    Marth. Most of the code is currently set up for Fox, and some testing needs to be done to set it  
    up fully for Marth. There is still a lot to do in those files to create adjustable parameters  
    that are set by user from their selections on the front end side.

Successes  
    The files that I (Kyle) pushed are a good movement to get finalized but there's still quite a bit  
    left to do and not a lot of time left to do it, so not sure if I would call any of it a success  
    yet.
    

Roadblocks/Challenges  
    The Slippi system itself. I (Kyle) have been having a hell of a time getting it to continuously  
    work for me.
      

Changes/Deviation from Plan ​(if applicable - if not, say so!)  
    I (Kyle) do not believe we will be able to have every character as an option for our product in  
    the time remaining. I think we will be able to maybe get three characters completely set up. So,  
    I have changed from trying to get all characters working to only getting two currently, and have  
    given up on getting a Machine Learning model involved for operating the characters.
      
Details Description of Goals/ Plan for ​Next 3 Weeks  
    Finish the couple characters we have, and work with the front end guys so all the work they've  
    done will be able to work with the back end work.


Confidence on completion from each team member + team average
Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident  
Kyle: 2.5/5. We will for sure have one character working and completely customizable in time, but  
    beyond that, I'm doubtful.
