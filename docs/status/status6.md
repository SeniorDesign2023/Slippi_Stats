Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks  
Finalize a bot that could run at least 1 character fully. Improve the front-end application's  
aesthetics, and have it's JSON output file be accepted by the backend code to adjust the settings.  
Make a video ad, and a rough draft of the presentation. 

Tasks Completed What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom)  
Beckham wound up finishing a bot that can play everybot, and has been fine tuning it to improve  
the bot's performance for all characters. Michael wrote a script for the video and assigned parts  
for each person and then edited the video together. Ben started on the presentation, and Kyle  
took what was started and created themed slides and recorded video clips to show off different  
types of built-in bots and another smash bros bot project, smashbot. Everyone pitched ideas and  
improvements for the presentation. The Front-end application got a glow up and now looks much  
better and has more drop down menus and sliders for users to adjust how the bot plays.

Successes  
Beckham has mostly finished the bot, the video was completed on time, the presentation was done  
enough for a decent presentation that allowed us to get good feed back to improve it for the  
actual presentation on the 20th. Front end looks much better and has more functionality.

Roadblocks/Challenges  
Finding time to get everyone together to practice presentations more (one person lives in  
Cheyenne increases difficulty of this). When one person makes a huge update in the code base for  
the back-end it makes it difficult to follow along and understand all the changes in a timely  
manner to be able to help effectively (A big part of this is the libmelee has a lot of weird  
things that take playing with to figure out what it does, due to many actions having the same  
name but working differently work every character). 

Changes/Deviation from Plan ​(if applicable - if not, say so!)  
We are not even close to the project that was pitched at the beginning of last semester, however,  
for this semester we have not deviated but were not able to get into several of the stretch goals  
we had wanted to reach.

Details Description of Goals/ Plan for ​Next 3 Weeks  
I believe this is the final summary so where our project can go from here. The bot can still be  
improved to have more options for customizable settings and a few more settings per option.  
We didn't get into the training an AI that can run the bot like another player, so that is still  
something that can be done in the future. 


Confidence on completion from each team member + team average Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident  
Kyle: 5/5.
